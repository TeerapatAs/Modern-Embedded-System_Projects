I used STM32F103C6T8 (Blue Pill) for these projects with ST-Link Connection.

1. Blinking LED by setting the pin with the **GPIO Map and Register Address**

2. Transmitting Data with **433 MHz RF**. Coding in Arduino IDE.

3. Get input data from ADC channels with **CPU Polling and DMA**.
   
4. Send data through **UART** serial communication.

5. Send data through **SPI** communication.

6. Send and receive data through **SPI** communication.
